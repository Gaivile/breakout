# Breakout
Classical Breakout game implementation in Clojure using Quil library.

## Game is finished!
The main objective is to remove all the bricks with a bouncing ball and to not let the ball fall down. In case of winning or losing, different screens appear - and the player can play again by simply clicking the mouse on the game screen. The colour of bricks is changing on each ball-brick collision.
